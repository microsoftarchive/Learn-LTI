## How to 

### Create a student account 
Sign into the [Microsoft Learn](http://docs.microsoft.com/learn) using your academic account to access your academic profile page on the Learn website.

If you have signed in with a general Microsoft account such as Hotmail, outlook or gmail you can merge two existing profiles. Assume you have profile A (Academic email) and profile B (MSA Hotmail, Gmail, outlook). You are able to merge your completions and achievements of profile B into profile A by clicking "add account" on the [Edit Your Profile page](https://techprofile.microsoft.com/edit) when signed into Profile A. 

After merging, only profile A will exist as both profiles learning history will be combined. The merging logic is as following:
Your learning history and achievements will be merged, with duplicates removed, from profile B into profile A.
Your Q&A contributions and activities will be merged, with duplicates removed, from profile B into profile A. Note that the data for who/what you are following on our Q&A platform won't be merged. Please make a note of who/what you are following on profile B, and manually re-follow after the merge is complete.
Your linked accounts will be merged from profile B into profile A. Note: if the limit of "up to five school or work accounts and one personal account" is exceeded during the merge process, your merge request will be cancelled. If this happens, you'll need to resolve this issue before trying again.
Your saved items and joined challenges will be merged, with duplicates removed, from profile B into profile A.
Private profile mode will be enabled if any of the two profiles has this setting turned on.
All other settings will remain unchanged in profile A and editable on Edit Your Profile page anytime.
