# For issues with the guides and tool

For any and all issues, please raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Learn-LTI/issues/new?WT.mc_id=learnlti-github-cxa) so we can help you.

## B2C Deployment Based Issues

If you have any B2C based issues please check [here](./B2C_Deployment.md#troubleshooting)

## General Deployment Issues

If your **deployment fails and the resource group has been created**; an IT admin needs to delete the resource group in their subscription and re-run the script again.

If your deployment has an error look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/common-deployment-errors?WT.mc_id=learnlti-github-cxa) for common errors.

## Setting up a DevTest Moodle LMS Environment 
If your looking at deploying the service for a DevTest Environment please follow the [DevTest Environment setup guide](DEVTESTENV.md)

## Ensure you install all the prerequisties 

â€œErrors while building Function App [ AssignmentLearnContent ]"

see [here](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

To begin, you will need to install the Prerequisites and reboot your machine

To begin, you will need:
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest?WT.mc_id=learnlti-github-cxa)
- [DotNet Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download?WT.mc_id=learnlti-github-cxa)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7?WT.mc_id=learnlti-github-cxa)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- An Azure subscription


## Failed deployment or removing the services

To remove the services simply run the [cleanup.bat](../deployment/cleanup.bat) script located in the Deployment folder. This will run the [Cleanup.ps1](../deployment/Cleanup.ps1) script which will remove all the deployed resources for the Learn LTI Application from your Azure Subscription.


### Cleaning up B2C vs AD:


When running [cleanup.bat](../deployment/cleanup.bat), you will be prompted to answer whether or not you have a b2c tenant to cleanup. 
![b2cclean.png](/images/b2cclean.png)
* If you chose 'b2c' mode during the deployment, then; when prompted if you have a b2c tenant to cleanup, select 'y'
    * After selecting 'y' the script will now run the b2c cleanup, please follow this [guide](./B2C_Cleanup.md) for more information on how to cleanup the B2C tenant.
* If you chose 'ad' mode during the deployment, then; when prompted if you have a b2c tenant to cleanup, select 'n' to skip this step


### Important Cleanup Notes

To Manually remove resources simply remove the Microsoft Learn LTI resource group and Microsoft Learn LTI Application Registration
 
- ResourceGroupName = "MSLearnLTI"
- AppName = "MS-Learn-Lti-Tool-App"

If you have changed the name of the Resource Group or AppName simply replace the actual names with the placeholder in the script.

Ensure you [purge your keyvault](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md#purging-key-vaults) before running the setup script again 


## Check the Failed Deployment status and output

From the Azure Portal, simply select deployments. See the following screenshot.

![FailedDeployments](../images/FailedDeployment.png)

## Errors deploying install scripts

Insufficient permissions if you try deploying the installation scripts from an account which is not your tenant AAD Admin or Azure Subscription Admin/Owner you will recieve an error

```
ERROR: Directory permission is needed for the current user to register the application. For how to configure, please refer 'https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal'. Original error: Insufficient privileges to complete the operation.
Transcript stopped, output file is C:\Users\Learn-LTI\deployment\Log\Transcript-05-01-2020-09-27-47.log
Press any Key to Exit:
```
To debug the error look at the Transcript-date-time.log file and the permissions error will be clearly shown.

The personas/responsibilities for setup are:
- Central IT (Azure tenant Owner, AAD Owner and have permissions to create service principals)
- LMS (Learning Management System Owner who needs to configure the LTI Application)
- Educator (who can provision learn modules into their course)

## Azure CLI Tool not installed

Exception.Message [ The term "az" is not recognized as a command applet name, function, script file, or executable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path exists, check that the path is correct and try again. ]

To run the install you need the Azure Command Line Extension tool installed see Instructions at: https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli for instructions. Please ensure you have all the prerequisites installed [check here](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#prerequisites)

## Wrong version of Azure CLI 

Failure in Step 10.  Exception.Message [ Failed to deploy Function App [ AssignmentLearnContent ] ]

### Sample Error Log

- [INFO] - Publishing Project [ Edna.AssignmentLearnContent.csproj ] as FunctionApp
- [INFO] - Building [ C:\Learn-Lti\Learn-LTI\backend\Functions\Edna.AssignmentLearnContent\Edna.AssignmentLearnContent ] --> [ Artifacts\AssignmentLearnContent ]

- [ERROR] - Exception.Type [ System.Management.Automation.RuntimeException ]
- [ERROR] - Error occurred while executing the Script. Please report the bug on Github (along with Error Message & Logs)

The problem was in the Azure CLI version, although we require a version > 2.0.21.There has been a issue reported with 2.29.0. Upgrading to version 2.29.1 resolves the issue.

## Error with .Net Core SDK 

When Deploying if you get stuck on Step 10. Please ensure you have at least version 3.1.100 of the .Net Core SDK x86 version installed
![NetCoreSDKError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3959829/166324637-d357169b-ee0d-4a50-bcfa-08fef04a3906.png)

Please ensure you have the [DotNet Core SDK .NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1?WT.mc_id=learnlti-github-cxa) installed

Note: Please ensure you reboot your machine after the installation of the Prerequisites as environmental variable need to be set after the installation.

If you have done this please uninstall your .NET Core SDK and reinstall the x86 version 3.1.100 and try again. 

## Debugging Errors from the deployment of Azure Functions 

Debugging Errors from the deployment

- Login to https://portal.azure.com
- Browse to function app > Platform Features Tab
- Click Deployment Options
- Click on failed Deployment
- Deployment status at the top is "Failed"

The log should lists a number of steps that were all successful and provide more details on the failure hopefully this should identify a permission issue or error.

## Purging Key Vaults

Your Azure Key Vault may be set to soft delete enabled. 

As such if you encounter a issue in the deployment you will have to delete your resource and deploy again you may be presented with this following error.

```bash
ERROR: Deployment failed. Correlation ID: ************-****-****-**********. {
  "error": {
    "code": "ParentResourceNotFound",
    "message": "Can not perform requested operation on nested resource. Parent resource 'kv-******' not found."
```

Due having soft delete enabled on the Key vault. The Key vault could not be recreated after the install initially fails.
See more details on [Azure Key Vault recovery overview | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery?tabs=azure-portal)

Key Vault Recovery features are designed to prevent the accidental or malicious deletion of your key vault and secrets, keys, and certificate stored inside key-vault. So under soft delete the key vault is still available for 90 days after deletion therefore you need to purge the deleted Key Valut before it can be recreated.  

### To purge a deleted Key vault

- Go to key vaults-> manage deleted vault
- Select the kv and select purge

See the following screenshot

![KeyVaultPurge](../images/Keyvaultpurge.png)

### If your Key Vault has purge protection enabled
With purge protection, a soft deleted key vault cannot be permanently deleted until after a configured purge window. This setting is generally reccomended to prevent malicious actors from deleting essesntial secrets. To further prevent tampering, purge protection cannot be disabled once it has been enabled. 

However, Key Vault names must be unique across Azure. If you attempt to create a Key Vault with the same name during a re-deploy of the LTI, you will see errors such as 

```bash
"code": "VaultAlreadyExists",

"message": "The vault name 'kv-******' is already in use. Vault names are globaly unique so it is possible that the name is already taken. If you are sure that the vault name was not taken then it is possible that a vault with the same name was recently deleted but not purged after being placed in a recoverable state. If the vault is in a recoverable state then the vault will need to be purged before reusing the name. For more information on soft delete and purging a vault follow this link https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2147740."
```

This will happen if you deploy the LTI using our deploy script, and then attempt to redeploy using the same configuration again. The cleanup script will not be able to delete the purge protected Key Vault.  In this situation, you must force the deploy scripts to generate a new name for the key vault it creates. We reccomend one of the below two options.

* In Deploy.ps1, modify the ResourceGroupName string to a new string such as MSLearnLTI_V1
* In azuredeploy.json, change the "uniqueIdentifier" variable to create a new substring. We suggest appending a number surrounded by single quotes after the resourceGroup().id. As an example, alter
** 
```bash
"uniqueIdentifier": "[substring(uniqueString(subscription().subscriptionId, resourceGroup().id),0,9)]",
```
To 
```bash
"uniqueIdentifier": "[substring(uniqueString(subscription().subscriptionId, resourceGroup().id, '1'),0,9)]",
```	


## LTI Application does not load error: {Message:"Oops Something went wrong"}

LMS Requirement for Secure Token SSL https

If you are deploying the service in a test environment please ensure that your test LMS environment had a valid SSL certificate installed we require all traffic to utilise SSL.

You will receive this error if you have are using http:// and not https:// for your LMS Environment. Oops something went wrong.

![NoSSLDeployment](../images/Oopswentwrong.png)

If you using a standard web server there a great tool for supporting installing SSL certs https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt simply choose the web server and platform and it will give you instructions.

## LTI Application Login error: You are not enrolled in this course

If you receive the following error.

![Learnltiadd](../images/LearnLTIAADIssue.png)

User not registered on the LMS or logged into Web Browser with the incorrect account
If using AAD 
- Ensure if you are using an Azure AD connected account, that the user is logged into their web browser with the same account they used to sign into the LMS.
- Please ensure that AAD sign for your LMS is enabled and you are signing into your LMS with a AAD account. 
- The emails of the users in the LMS and AAD should match.
- Ensure the users are active on the course.

For troubleshooting see *Azure Functions Tracing* and *Failure is in Users Function App* below.

## LTI Application does not load error: {"Message":"Could not validate nonce."}

If you receive a browser message: {"Message":"Could not validate nonce."}

We have seen this is an intermittent issue, it usually happens if the user is trying to replay an old call or if the nonce and state value don't match. If the user simply refreshes the browser the page will load.

## LTI Application does not load error: {"Message":"Could not validate request"}

This issue is typically related to one of the following:

- Check if you have a valid 3rd Party Signed SSL. This services requires a valid 3rd party SSL certificate, self signed SSL certificates are not valid. Please ensure your service is using https:// with a valid SSL certification.
- Check the Launch URL, please make sure that all the fields are correctly filled while registering the tool and filling tool's platform registration page. See [here](./CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)
- Check the Azure Function/Azure Logs see [here](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md#azure-functions-tracing)

## LTI Application does not load error: No sufficient permissions to view this page

After you have successfully installed the Learn LTI application by running the deployment steps you try to access the created Platform Registration Page results and recieve the message 'No sufficient permissions to view this page'.

Solution:

- Go to the 'platforms' azure function inside of the resource group which was just created.
- Go to 'Configuration' one the left side
- Look into the 'AllowedUsers' environment variable.
- Verify the email address of the user you are logged in with is included in the environment variable (!THIS IS CASE SENSITIVE!)
- If it does not match or exist, update the environment variable and save the change.
- Wait a minute to let change take effect and retry!

We have seen cases where the email address was added there but the case is different i.e. capital first letters while the email address of the login user had lowercase)

## Adding SSL Certificates to your Development Environment

You can use Letâ€™s Encrypt, if you don't have a valid SSL certificates for your development environment, Let Encrypt will allow you to setup a [Free SSL](https://letsencrypt.org/)

If you using a standard web server there a great tool for supporting installing SSL certs https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt simply choose the web server and platform and it will give you instructions.

## Moodle: Bitnami Image and setting up SSL

If your moodle deployment does not have a valid SSL you will receive the following error Oops something went wrong 

![NoSSLDeployment](../images/Oopswentwrong.png)

You simply need to ensure your LMS installation has a valid DNS name and SSL. Use link for the [instructions Generate and Install a Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate for a Bitnami Application](https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl)

If you need help configuring your Bitnami HTTPS Configuration see the following [configure HTTPS certificates](https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/how-to/understand-bncert/)

If you still receive this error after these changes check *Failures (Exceptions) in App Insights* and if you see a 401 error see Solution: *Error Unauthorized 401 when using Moodle*

## Moodle: Users not active - Not Current

All users need to be Active on a course if you see Not Current next to the status.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2511341/108256622-a3406f80-7155-11eb-9ef2-b9b42faf324f.png)

We have noticed that users having this issue

![ErrorNoValidUsers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31847926/94229941-2b726e00-ff44-11ea-8343-30ad6bab348e.png)

We have seen this where students/teacher may of been manually assigned or automatically assigned as showing  "Not Current".

![NotCurrent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3178741/94397091-b8603600-0195-11eb-9e76-f0213684c1aa.png)

The solution is simply make the students and teachers active and they can then log in. 
To activate users: Click on the settings wheel in the top right hand corner and select "Enrollment methods" then click the crossed out eye to allow manual enrollment.

When you go back to the course participants they will show as active and users will be able to load the Learn LTI application.

## Canvas: LMS Issuer

If your using on premise, hosted or cloud implementations of Canvas. Ensure you register the parameters back in the Learn LTI application's registration page. Please ensure you always state the  Issuer as https://canvas.instructure.com see the final steps in the Canvas instructions [here](./CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)

## Canvas: Error - {Message}:{"Could not validate request."}? 

We have seen this issue when users are using the Canvas Bitnami image in Azure.

You need to create the following config files files in canvas system:
/opt/bitnami/apps/canvaslms/htdocs/config/dynamic_settings.yml copying the content from existing /opt/bitnami/apps/canvaslms/htdocs/config/dynamic_settings.yml.example and added following lines below (include your secrets adjusted):

production:

```bash

## Step by step guide to connect the SSO experience with AAD

The details provided at [Planning Active Directory SSO Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/plan-sso-deployment)

## Steps if your an Office365/Microsoft365 institution but unsure of your Active Directory Details

Microsoft 365 uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to manage user identities behind the scenes. Your Microsoft 365 subscription includes a free Azure AD subscription so that you can integrate your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to synchronize user accounts and passwords or set up single sign-on.

Azure AD also offers other functionality, like managing integrated apps, that you can use to extend and customize your Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

You can use the Azure AD deployment advisors for a guided setup and configuration experience in the Microsoft 365 admin center (you must be signed in to Microsoft 365):

- [Azure AD Connect advisor](https://aka.ms/aadconnectpwsync)
- [AD FS deployment advisor](https://aka.ms/adfsguidance)
- [Azure AD setup guide](https://aka.ms/aadpguidance)

If you have a paid subscription to Microsoft 365, you also have a free Azure AD subscription. You can use Azure AD to create and manage user and group accounts. To activate this subscription, you have to complete a [one-time registration.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/use-your-free-azure-ad-subscription-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide) Afterward, you can access Azure AD from your Microsoft 365 admin center.

Don't go directly to azure.microsoft.com to sign up or you'll end up with a trial or paid subscription to Microsoft Azure that is separate from your free Azure AD subscription with Microsoft 365.

With the free subscription you can synchronize with on-premises directories, set up single sign-on, and synchronize with many software as service applications.

If you want enhanced AD DS functionality, bi-directional synchronization, and other management capabilities, you can upgrade your free subscription to a paid premium subscription. For the details, see [Azure Active Directory editions.](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/)

## Troubleshooting Azure Resource Manager Deployments

In order to understand the issue in more detail, one way could be to go through the deployment details which could be accessed via Azure Portal.

- Go to Azure Portal
- Choose appropriate Subscription
- Select Resource Groups blade from Left Rail
- Choose appropriate Resource Group
- Select Deployments Blade from Left Rail.
- The log will show which service deployments failed

## Azure Resources Deployments errors

You could consider trying to re-deploy the same RG/Identity/AppName combination by simply re-executing run.bat or deploy a new RG inside a different region than the one tried previously. Running the same script and resource group names will also create a error if the services and resources are already present for those regions and names.

## Using Hosted services on Cloudfront

We have seen a issue where the "Authorization" header was not being forwarded to the backend by AWS CloudFront. See the following documentation 
[Configure CloudFront to Forward Authorization Headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html#add-origin-custom-headers-forward-authorization?WT.mc_id=edna)

## Debugging Errors related to http500 indicated in Browser with Oops! Something went wrong.. We suggest you go to our help page

This results in you being unable to open the Assignments page in Learn-LTI. Users access failing with http500 which essentially has been the source of the Oops! Something went wrong error message in the browser window.

Please see browser logs if indicate that the membership call being sent to the LMS (Moodle) is returning a 401 Unauthorized and the Learn LTI tool in unable to get the course members from the LMS and hence the it is giving a 500 response. 

Please make sure that while configuring the tool in Moodle, Under Services, IMS LTI Names and Role Provisioning: `Use this service to retrieve membersâ€™ information as per privacy settings.` is selected as mentioned in the [Configuration Guide Learn](CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)
![UseServicetoretrievemembers](../images/Config.8.png)

# Troubleshooting Errors 

## Azure Functions Tracing

This should provide details related to the execution context and state of the function execution when it has returned http 204 error.

- Goto your Resource Group inside Azure and select Function App matching users-XXXXXXX.
- Select Functions Blade in Left Hand Pane.
- Select GetUserDetails afterwards.
- Choose Monitor Blade in LHP and you should see the Invocation Traces.
- Clicking on the failing trace should provide more details related to Server logs for that function invocation to help you.

## Failures (Exceptions) in App Insights

- Go to your Resource Group inside Azure and select Application Insights resource matching users-XXXXXXX.
- Select Failures Blade in LHP and then choose Exceptions Tab.
- The subsequent screen should indicate any exceptions that were thrown as a part of function execution and should provide more insights into what might've gone wrong on server when executing GetUserDetails api.
- We'd request you to please share the above details with us in order for us to be able to help you in a better way. Since the details might contain some private information as well. Please feel free to reach out to us via email at learnlti@microsoft.com.

## Failure is in Users Function App

Function app which is not being able to find the user (signed-in via AAD) enrolled into the current course. 

Please check that the return code for the API in the Chrome DevTools network tab is http204 (i.e. No-Content).

In our experience, the only case when this happens is when user signs into Learn-LTI app with an onmicrosoft.com account which does not map to the email of any of the enrolled users of the course.

## Testing the LTI Services responses using ZTest
You can test the LTI responses from your LMS to ensure LTI messages/calls are being successfully recieved and sent by using ZTest link: https://ztest.cengage.info/ztest/

Here are the steps for installing [ZTest Tool](ZTEST.md) (you can install ZTest by following the steps in the doc)

## Understanding what the Azuredeploy.json implements when running the run.bat/Deploy.ps1
